# Dex Plugin Distribution - Executive Summary

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Status:** Ready for Testing Phase
**Estimated Time to Launch:** 1-2 weeks

---

## What We Built

I've converted your Vault/Dex system into a proper **Claude Code plugin** that can be distributed to users with **zero dependency** on your personal vault data.

### What This Means

Users can now install Dex with one command:
```bash
claude plugin install https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dex
```

No manual file copying, no complex setup—just install and run `/setup`.

## Files Created for You

### 1. **Plugin Manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)
- Defines Dex as a Claude Code plugin
- Configures all 9 MCP servers
- Specifies Python requirements
- Ready to publish

### 2. **Documentation**

```

**Pros:**
- Professional distribution
- Can add more plugins later (Dex Premium, integrations, etc.)
- Full control, no approval delays
- Build a brand

**Next steps:**
1. Create separate marketplace repository
2. Configure marketplace.json
3. Link to your dex repository

### Option 3: Official Marketplace 📦 **FOR SCALE**

```bash
claude plugin install dex  # from official marketplace
```

**Pros:**

## What Makes This Special

Most Claude Code plugins are **skills** or **agents** that augment your workflow.

**Dex is an entire operating system:**
- Creates a complete vault structure
- Manages persistent state (tasks, people, projects)
- Has intelligent onboarding
- Learns over time
- Compounds value with each interaction

This is more ambitious than typical plugins—think **"operating system installer"** rather than **"productivity add-on"**.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Plugin structure is solid
- Your existing system already works
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Python MCP servers are battle-tested

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Python dependency management (users need pip)
- Path configuration (VAULT_PATH environment variable)
- Onboarding complexity (9 steps)

**Mitigation:**
- Clear installation docs (created ✅)
- Error messages guide users to solutions
- Beta test with diverse users first

### High Risk 🔴
- None identified

---

## Success Metrics

Track these after launch:

### Week 1:
- 5 successful beta installations
- No blocker bugs reported
- Installation takes < 10 minutes

### Month 1:
- 50+ GitHub stars
- 25+ active users
- < 5% installation failure rate
- Positive feedback on LinkedIn/X

### Month 3:
- 200+ GitHub stars
- 100+ active users
- Featured in Vibe PM podcast
- Inquiries about enterprise version

---

## Revenue Potential (Future)

Not urgent, but if you want to monetize later:

### Freemium Model
- **Free:** Current Dex (everything you've built)
- **Pro ($10/mo):** Advanced integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack)
- **Enterprise ($50/user/mo):** Team deployment, custom setup, priority support

### Conservative Estimate:
- 100 free users → 10 Pro ($100/mo) → $1,200/year
- 500 free users → 50 Pro ($500/mo) → $6,000/year
- 5 enterprise customers → $3,000/mo → $36,000/year

**Total potential:** $42,000/year (conservative)

This assumes 10% free-to-paid conversion, which is standard for dev tools.
